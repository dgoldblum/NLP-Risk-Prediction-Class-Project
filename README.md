# NLP-Risk-Prediction-Class-Project
Project from Advanced Computational Finance course.

Used earnings call transcript data (provided by the professor) to classify businesses as financial institutions or not, and then predict their risk. Used a series of classifiers and regressors from SKLearn with voting to get optimized results. XGBoost and LightGBM were used in addition to testing with custon Neural Network classifiers and regressors.

NLP methods used:
  Word2Vec
  Doc2Vec
  LDA
  TFID
Other NLP methods tested:
  BERT transformers

Libraries Used:
  NLTK
  PyTorch
  TensorFlow
  Genism
  SKLearn
  XGBoost
